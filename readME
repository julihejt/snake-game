Overview
This project is a browser-based Snake game, where the player controls a snake that moves around the game board, eating food to grow longer. The goal is to keep the snake alive by avoiding collisions with the walls or itself while trying to achieve the highest score possible.

Features
Responsive Design: The game is playable on different screen sizes.
High Score Tracking: The game tracks the highest score achieved during the current session.
Difficulty Progression: The speed of the snake increases as it eats more food, making the game progressively more challenging.
Keyboard Controls: The game is controlled using the arrow keys on your keyboard.
Retro Style: Inspired by classic arcade games, featuring a minimalist design and pixelated graphics.
How to Play
Press the space bar to start the game.
Control the snake using the arrow keys:
Up Arrow: Move up
Down Arrow: Move down
Left Arrow: Move left
Right Arrow: Move right
The goal is to eat the food that appears on the board. Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer.
Avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. If a collision occurs, the game is over, and you can restart by pressing the space bar again.
The game tracks your score, which is based on the length of the snake. Try to beat your highest score!
